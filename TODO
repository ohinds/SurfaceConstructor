* need a better way of judging if a contour is almost closed. 

* better branching soln:
iteratively look for sub-contour matches. use a correspondence-like
solution to judge the fitness of a sub-contour match. have to think of
a way to make the matching work well for both large contour match
lengths and small ones. 

* use straight skeleton instead of medial axis for capping.

* add vertices when necessary to avoid self-interescting tilings

* reconstruct the nuages examples

* fix coordinate dimension permutation when the slice direction is changed
